# Kimchi
## Ingredients
### Main
1-2 heads of napa cabbage (Get enough for 6lbs worth = yield 3 liters)  
4 TBSP salt (per head of cabbage, but honestly it doesn't matter, just salt it a shit ton)  

### Other Vegs (all optional tbh)
1-1.5 carrots, fine julienned (basically thinly sliced into straws)  
1/2 onion, thinly sliced  
4 stalks green onion, cut into 3-4 inches length  
1/4 of a daikon (around 3 inches length), batonned (french fry sized)  

### Paste
whole head of garlic (or less, if garlic isn't your thing), peeled   
1 tsp ginger  
1/2 tsp beef dashida (BEEF BOULLION, MSG)  
3 tsp sugar  
2 1/2 tsp salted fermented shrimp sauce (Saeujeot)  
1/2 cup (Anchovy) fish sauce  
1/2 cup korean red pepper flakes (gochugaru, or to preferred spicy level, which also depends on the brand)  

## Instructions
1. Cut the napa cabbage into "rectangles". The way I cut it is to cut the napa cabbage length-wise into quarters (cut in half, then cut that in half), cut off the core of the cabbage but cutting at an angle, and the slicing those long quarters into 1 inch or 1 1/2 inches which gives a decent sized bite. 

2. In a large bowl, add (ideally) kosher salt or pickling salt to the bottom. Add in a handful of the cut cabbage, and then add salt on top of that, then add another handful of cabbage and so on. The amount of salt doesn't matter much, I'd say around 1 tbsp of salt for each "layer". The goal here is to wilt the cabbage and remove that moisture.

3. Let the salted cabbage sit there for ~30 minutes or more, or until A LOT of water has come out. I've had it rest for more than an hour and had no issues. You can also occasionally push and "knead" the cabbage while it sits to help with the moisture removal. Bruising it is A OK.

4. Cut the other veggies and set them aside. For the onions cut in half (from the top to the bottom, where the roots are), and then remove the top and bottom. Cut thinly in the same direction as when halving (NOT horizontal against the grain, we don't want an orbital semi-circle shape...why? because it's less aesthetic, and also different texture. There's a whole deep dive video on this)

5. In a food processor/blender, add in everything under the paste section EXCEPT for the red pepper flakes. Blend it and then add the red pepper flakes.

6. When the cabbage is done wilting, fill the bowl with the cabbage full of water. Grab a handful of cabbage and swish it around, take it out of the water and squeeze as much of the water out as possible. Put it into a colander to drain. Repeat this until all of the cabbage is out.

7. Do step six 2-3 times, until the cabbage doesn't taste too salty. This is personal preference. Eat a piece of cabbage, if it tastes good, something that you could snack on without thinking "damn this is too salty" but still has flavour, then you're done. The cabbage does not need to be drained completely of water.

8. Prepare a large jar (or two, or however many that will fit the kimchi). Make sure it is an air tight container, and that it is ***CLEAN**. You do not want your kimchi to mold. DO NOT use a container that will barely fit all your kimchi, there NEEDS to be room for it to breath, otherwise you will be having a bad time.

9. In the mixing bowl that you used for the cabbage (drained of the water ofc), add back in your cabbage, and add in the rest of the veggies. Add in the paste and wearing gloves, mix in the paste thoroughly. 

10. Transfer the kimchi to your jars. Ensure that the leftover juice in the mixing bowl is added to the jars as well, you want the liquid to submerge the vegetables ideally. If it doesn't, add some water + some fish sauce until it is covered. Maybe 25% of fish sauce to water?

11. Close the lid and let it ferment at room temperature for 3-7 days. How long you ferment is up to you and how you want your kimchi to taste. I personally ferment it for 3 days, and then afterwards I taste and ferment for more if it's not sour enough for my liking. Everyday you ferment you should be checking in on it, opening the jar to let out the gasses, and mixing the kimchi from the bottom to the top.

12. Once it's to your liking, refrigerate it.
